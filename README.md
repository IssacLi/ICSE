# ICSE

This folder belongs to the paper(smartFix: Context-aware and Low-cost Smart Contract Repair), which is submiited for ICSE 2024. It contains two parts: Dataset and SmartFix. 

Dataset folder only contains a download link for full dataset in the txt file, since the github has upload size limitation.

SmartFix contains three parts. The module folder includes Information Extraction Module(IEM) and Patch Generation Module(PGM) that we described in our paper. The templates folder includes patch templates for each vulnerability.
